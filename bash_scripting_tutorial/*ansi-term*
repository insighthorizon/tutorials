NAME
       sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text

SYNOPSIS
       sed [OPTION]... {script-only-if-no-other-script} [input-file]...

DESCRIPTION
       Sed  is  a  stream  editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input
       stream (a file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways  similar  to  an  editor  which  permits
       scripted  edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently
       more efficient.  But it is sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes
       it from other types of editors.

       -n, --quiet, --silent

              suppress automatic printing of pattern space

       -e script, --expression=script

              add the script to the commands to be executed

       -f script-file, --file=script-file

              add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed

       --follow-symlinks

              follow symlinks when processing in place

       -i[SUFFIX], --in-place[=SUFFIX]

              edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)

       -l N, --line-length=N

              specify the desired line-wrap length for the `l' command

       --posix

              disable all GNU extensions.

       -r, --regexp-extended

              use extended regular expressions in the script.

       -s, --separate

              consider files as separate rather than as a single continuous long stream.

       -u, --unbuffered

              load minimal amounts of data from the input files and flush the output buffers more often

       -z, --null-data

NAME
       xargs - build and execute command lines from standard input

SYNOPSIS
       xargs  [-0prtx]  [-E  eof-str]  [-e[eof-str]]  [--eof[=eof-str]]  [--null] [-d delimiter] [--delimiter
       delimiter] [-I replace-str] [-i[replace-str]] [--replace[=replace-str]] [-l[max-lines]] [-L max-lines]
       [--max-lines[=max-lines]]  [-n  max-args] [--max-args=max-args] [-s max-chars] [--max-chars=max-chars]
       [-P max-procs] [--max-procs=max-procs] [--process-slot-var=name] [--interactive] [--verbose]  [--exit]
       [--no-run-if-empty]   [--arg-file=file]   [--show-limits]   [--version]  [--help]  [command  [initial-
       arguments]]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of xargs.  xargs reads items from the standard  input,  de‐
       limited  by  blanks  (which can be protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or newlines,
       and executes the command (default is /bin/echo) one or more times with any initial-arguments  followed
       by items read from standard input.  Blank lines on the standard input are ignored.

       The command line for command is built up until it reaches a system-defined limit (unless the -n and -L
       options are used).  The specified command will be invoked as many times as necessary  to  use  up  the
       list  of  input  items.   In  general, there will be many fewer invocations of command than there were
       items in the input.  This will normally have significant performance benefits.  Some commands can use‐
       fully be executed in parallel too; see the -P option.

       Because  Unix  filenames can contain blanks and newlines, this default behaviour is often problematic;
       filenames containing blanks and/or newlines are incorrectly processed by xargs.  In  these  situations
       it  is  better  to  use the -0 option, which prevents such problems.   When using this option you will
       need to ensure that the program which produces the input for xargs also uses a  null  character  as  a
       separator.  If that program is GNU find for example, the -print0 option does this for you.

       If any invocation of the command exits with a status of 255, xargs will stop immediately without read‐
       ing any further input.  An error message is issued on stderr when this happens.

OPTIONS
       -0, --null
              Input items are terminated by a null character instead of by whitespace,  and  the  quotes  and
              backslash  are  not  special  (every  character  is taken literally).  Disables the end of file
              string, which is treated like any other argument.  Useful when input items might contain  white
              space,  quote  marks,  or backslashes.  The GNU find -print0 option produces input suitable for
              this mode.

       -a file, --arg-file=file
              Read items from file instead of standard input.  If you use  this  option,  stdin  remains  un‐
              changed when commands are run.  Otherwise, stdin is redirected from /dev/null.

       --delimiter=delim, -d delim
              Input items are terminated by the specified character.  The specified delimiter may be a single
              character, a C-style character escape such as \n, or an octal or hexadecimal escape code.   Oc‐
              tal  and hexadecimal escape codes are understood as for the printf command.   Multibyte charac‐
              ters are not supported.  When processing the input, quotes and backslash are not special; every
              character  in  the  input  is  taken literally.  The -d option disables any end-of-file string,
              which is treated like any other argument.  You can use this option when the input  consists  of
              simply  newline-separated  items, although it is almost always better to design your program to
              use --null where this is possible.

GIT(1)                                            Git Manual                                           GIT(1)

NAME
       git - the stupid content tracker

SYNOPSIS
       git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p|--paginate|--no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that
       provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

       See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see giteveryday(7) for a useful minimum set of commands. The
       Git User’s Manual[1] has a more in-depth introduction.

       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git
       offers. You can learn more about individual Git commands with "git help command". gitcli(7) manual
       page gives you an overview of the command-line command syntax.

       Formatted and hyperlinked version of the latest Git documentation can be viewed at
       http://git-htmldocs.googlecode.com/git/git.html.

OPTIONS
       --version
           Prints the Git suite version that the git program came from.

       --help
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands. If the option --all or -a is
           given then all available commands are printed. If a Git command is named this option will bring up
           the manual page for that command.

           Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed. See git-help(1) for more
           information, because git --help ...  is converted internally into git help ....

       -C <path>
           Run as if git was started in <path> instead of the current working directory. When multiple -C
           options are given, each subsequent non-absolute -C <path> is interpreted relative to the preceding
           -C <path>.

           This option affects options that expect path name like --git-dir and --work-tree in that their
           interpretations of the path names would be made relative to the working directory caused by the -C
           option. For example the following invocations are equivalent:

               git --git-dir=a.git --work-tree=b -C c status
               git --git-dir=c/a.git --work-tree=c/b status

       -c <name>=<value>
           Pass a configuration parameter to the command. The value given will override values from
           configuration files. The <name> is expected in the same format as listed by git config (subkeys
           separated by dots).

           Note that omitting the = in git -c foo.bar ...  is allowed and sets foo.bar to the boolean true
           value (just like [foo]bar would in a config file). Including the equals but with an empty value

           If the object storage directory is specified via this environment variable then the sha1
           directories are created underneath - otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects directory is used.

       GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
           Due to the immutable nature of Git objects, old objects can be archived into shared, read-only
           directories. This variable specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list of Git object
           directories which can be used to search for Git objects. New objects will not be written to these
           directories.

       GIT_DIR
           If the GIT_DIR environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of the default
           .git for the base of the repository. The --git-dir command-line option also sets this value.

       GIT_WORK_TREE
           Set the path to the root of the working tree. This can also be controlled by the --work-tree
           command-line option and the core.worktree configuration variable.

       GIT_NAMESPACE
           Set the Git namespace; see gitnamespaces(7) for details. The --namespace command-line option also
           sets this value.

       GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
           This should be a colon-separated list of absolute paths. If set, it is a list of directories that
           Git should not chdir up into while looking for a repository directory (useful for excluding
           slow-loading network directories). It will not exclude the current working directory or a GIT_DIR
           set on the command line or in the environment. Normally, Git has to read the entries in this list
           and resolve any symlink that might be present in order to compare them with the current directory.
           However, if even this access is slow, you can add an empty entry to the list to tell Git that the
           subsequent entries are not symlinks and needn’t be resolved; e.g.,
           GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES=/maybe/symlink::/very/slow/non/symlink.

       GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM
           When run in a directory that does not have ".git" repository directory, Git tries to find such a
           directory in the parent directories to find the top of the working tree, but by default it does
           not cross filesystem boundaries. This environment variable can be set to true to tell Git not to
           stop at filesystem boundaries. Like GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES, this will not affect an explicit
           repository directory set via GIT_DIR or on the command line.

       GIT_COMMON_DIR
           If this variable is set to a path, non-worktree files that are normally in $GIT_DIR will be taken
           from this path instead. Worktree-specific files such as HEAD or index are taken from $GIT_DIR. See
           gitrepository-layout(5) and git-worktree(1) for details. This variable has lower precedence than
           other path variables such as GIT_INDEX_FILE, GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY...

NAME
       git - the stupid content tracker

SYNOPSIS
       git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p|--paginate|--no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that
       provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

       See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see giteveryday(7) for a useful minimum set of commands. The
       Git User’s Manual[1] has a more in-depth introduction.

       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git
       offers. You can learn more about individual Git commands with "git help command". gitcli(7) manual
       page gives you an overview of the command-line command syntax.

       Formatted and hyperlinked version of the latest Git documentation can be viewed at
       http://git-htmldocs.googlecode.com/git/git.html.

OPTIONS
       --version
           Prints the Git suite version that the git program came from.

       --help
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands. If the option --all or -a is
           given then all available commands are printed. If a Git command is named this option will bring up
           the manual page for that command.

           Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed. See git-help(1) for more
           information, because git --help ...  is converted internally into git help ....

       -C <path>
           Run as if git was started in <path> instead of the current working directory. When multiple -C
           options are given, each subsequent non-absolute -C <path> is interpreted relative to the preceding
           -C <path>.

           This option affects options that expect path name like --git-dir and --work-tree in that their
           interpretations of the path names would be made relative to the working directory caused by the -C
           option. For example the following invocations are equivalent:

               git --git-dir=a.git --work-tree=b -C c status
               git --git-dir=c/a.git --work-tree=c/b status

       -c <name>=<value>
           Pass a configuration parameter to the command. The value given will override values from
           configuration files. The <name> is expected in the same format as listed by git config (subkeys
           separated by dots).

           Note that omitting the = in git -c foo.bar ...  is allowed and sets foo.bar to the boolean true
           value (just like [foo]bar would in a config file). Including the equals but with an empty value

       GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
           If the object storage directory is specified via this environment variable then the sha1

           won’t affect existing index files. By default index file version 2 or 3 is used. See git-update-
           index(1) for more information.

       GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
           If the object storage directory is specified via this environment variable then the sha1
           directories are created underneath - otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects directory is used.

       GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
           Due to the immutable nature of Git objects, old objects can be archived into shared, read-only
           directories. This variable specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list of Git object
           directories which can be used to search for Git objects. New objects will not be written to these
           directories.

       GIT_DIR
           If the GIT_DIR environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of the default
           .git for the base of the repository. The --git-dir command-line option also sets this value.

       GIT_WORK_TREE
           Set the path to the root of the working tree. This can also be controlled by the --work-tree
           command-line option and the core.worktree configuration variable.

       GIT_NAMESPACE
           Set the Git namespace; see gitnamespaces(7) for details. The --namespace command-line option also
           sets this value.

       GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
           This should be a colon-separated list of absolute paths. If set, it is a list of directories that
           Git should not chdir up into while looking for a repository directory (useful for excluding
           slow-loading network directories). It will not exclude the current working directory or a GIT_DIR
           set on the command line or in the environment. Normally, Git has to read the entries in this list
           and resolve any symlink that might be present in order to compare them with the current directory.
           However, if even this access is slow, you can add an empty entry to the list to tell Git that the
           subsequent entries are not symlinks and needn’t be resolved; e.g.,
           GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES=/maybe/symlink::/very/slow/non/symlink.

       GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM
           When run in a directory that does not have ".git" repository directory, Git tries to find such a
           directory in the parent directories to find the top of the working tree, but by default it does
           not cross filesystem boundaries. This environment variable can be set to true to tell Git not to
           stop at filesystem boundaries. Like GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES, this will not affect an explicit
           repository directory set via GIT_DIR or on the command line.

       GIT_COMMON_DIR
           If this variable is set to a path, non-worktree files that are normally in $GIT_DIR will be taken
           from this path instead. Worktree-specific files such as HEAD or index are taken from $GIT_DIR. See
           gitrepository-layout(5) and git-worktree(1) for details. This variable has lower precedence than
           other path variables such as GIT_INDEX_FILE, GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY...

READ(2)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                   READ(2)

NAME
       read - read from a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
       read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf.

       On  files  that support seeking, the read operation commences at the current file offset, and the file
       offset is incremented by the number of bytes read.  If the current file offset is at or past  the  end
       of file, no bytes are read, and read() returns zero.

       If  count  is zero, read() may detect the errors described below.  In the absence of any errors, or if
       read() does not check for errors, a read() with a count of 0 returns zero and has no other effects.

       If count is greater than SSIZE_MAX, the result is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero indicates end of file), and the  file  position
       is  advanced  by  this  number.  It is not an error if this number is smaller than the number of bytes
       requested; this may happen for example because fewer bytes are actually  available  right  now  (maybe
       because  we  were close to end-of-file, or because we are reading from a pipe, or from a terminal), or
       because read() was interrupted by a signal.  See also NOTES.

       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.   In  this  case,  it  is  left  unspecified
       whether the file position (if any) changes.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN The  file  descriptor  fd  refers to a file other than a socket and has been marked nonblocking
              (O_NONBLOCK), and the read would block.  See open(2) for  further  details  on  the  O_NONBLOCK
              flag.

       EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
              The file descriptor fd refers to a socket and has been marked nonblocking (O_NONBLOCK), and the
              read would block.  POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be returned for this case, and does  not
              require these constants to have the same value, so a portable application should check for both
              possibilities.

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.

       EFAULT buf is outside your accessible address space.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal before any data was read; see signal(7).

       EINVAL fd is attached to an object which is unsuitable for reading; or the file was  opened  with  the
              O_DIRECT  flag,  and  either the address specified in buf, the value specified in count, or the
              current file offset is not suitably aligned.

       EINVAL fd was created via a call to timerfd_create(2) and the wrong size buffer was given  to  read();
              see timerfd_create(2) for further information.

       EIO    I/O  error.   This  will  happen for example when the process is in a background process group,
              tries to read from its controlling terminal, and either it is ignoring or blocking  SIGTTIN  or
              its  process  group  is  orphaned.  It may also occur when there is a low-level I/O error while
              reading from a disk or tape.

       man  is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program,
       utility or function.  The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found  and  dis‐
       played.   A  section,  if  provided,  will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The
       default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order ("1 n l 8 3
       2  3posix  3pm  3perl  5  4 9 6 7" by default, unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/man‐

NAME
       man - macros to format man pages

SYNOPSIS
       groff -Tascii -man file ...

       groff -Tps -man file ...

       man [section] title

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page explains the groff an.tmac macro package (often called the man macro package).  This
       macro package should be used by developers when writing or porting man pages for Linux.  It is  fairly
       compatible with other versions of this macro package, so porting man pages should not be a major prob‐
       lem (exceptions include the NET-2 BSD release, which uses a totally  different  macro  package  called
       mdoc; see mdoc(7)).

       Note  that  NET-2  BSD  mdoc  man  pages  can be used with groff simply by specifying the -mdoc option
       instead of the -man option.  Using the -mandoc option is, however, recommended, since this will  auto‐
       matically detect which macro package is in use.

       For  conventions  that  should be employed when writing man pages for the Linux man-pages package, see
       man-pages(7).

   Title line
       The first command in a man page (after comment lines, that is, lines that start with .\") should be

              .TH title section date source manual

       For details of the arguments that should be supplied to the TH command, see man-pages(7).

       Note that BSD mdoc-formatted pages begin with the Dd command, not the TH command.

   Sections
       Sections are started with .SH followed by the heading name.

       The only mandatory heading is NAME, which should be the first section and be followed on the next line
       by a one-line description of the program:

              .SH NAME
              item \- description

       It  is extremely important that this format is followed, and that there is a backslash before the sin‐
       gle dash which follows the item name.  This syntax is used by the mandb(8) program to create  a  data‐
       base  of  short  descriptions  for the whatis(1) and apropos(1) commands.  (See lexgrog(1) for further
       details on the syntax of the NAME section.)

       For a list of other sections that might appear in a manual page, see man-pages(7).

   Fonts
       The commands to select the type face are:

       .B  Bold

       .BI Bold alternating with italics (especially useful for function specifications)

       .BR Bold alternating with Roman (especially useful for referring to other manual pages)

READ(2)                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                   READ(2)

NAME
       read - read from a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
       read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf.

       On  files  that support seeking, the read operation commences at the current file offset, and the file
       offset is incremented by the number of bytes read.  If the current file offset is at or past  the  end
       of file, no bytes are read, and read() returns zero.

       If  count  is zero, read() may detect the errors described below.  In the absence of any errors, or if
       read() does not check for errors, a read() with a count of 0 returns zero and has no other effects.

       If count is greater than SSIZE_MAX, the result is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero indicates end of file), and the  file  position
       is  advanced  by  this  number.  It is not an error if this number is smaller than the number of bytes
       requested; this may happen for example because fewer bytes are actually  available  right  now  (maybe
       because  we  were close to end-of-file, or because we are reading from a pipe, or from a terminal), or
       because read() was interrupted by a signal.  See also NOTES.

       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.   In  this  case,  it  is  left  unspecified
       whether the file position (if any) changes.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN The  file  descriptor  fd  refers to a file other than a socket and has been marked nonblocking
              (O_NONBLOCK), and the read would block.  See open(2) for  further  details  on  the  O_NONBLOCK
              flag.

       EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
              The file descriptor fd refers to a socket and has been marked nonblocking (O_NONBLOCK), and the
              read would block.  POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be returned for this case, and does  not
              require these constants to have the same value, so a portable application should check for both
              possibilities.

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.

       EFAULT buf is outside your accessible address space.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal before any data was read; see signal(7).

       EINVAL fd is attached to an object which is unsuitable for reading; or the file was  opened  with  the
              O_DIRECT  flag,  and  either the address specified in buf, the value specified in count, or the
              current file offset is not suitably aligned.

       EINVAL fd was created via a call to timerfd_create(2) and the wrong size buffer was given  to  read();
              see timerfd_create(2) for further information.

       EIO    I/O  error.   This  will  happen for example when the process is in a background process group,
              tries to read from its controlling terminal, and either it is ignoring or blocking  SIGTTIN  or
              its  process  group  is  orphaned.  It may also occur when there is a low-level I/O error while
              reading from a disk or tape.

       This page is part of release 4.04 of the Linux man-pages  project.   A  description  of  the  project,
       information   about   reporting  bugs,  and  the  latest  version  of  this  page,  can  be  found  at
       http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/.
       On Linux, read() (and similar system calls) will transfer at most  0x7ffff000  (2,147,479,552)  bytes,
       returning the number of bytes actually transferred.  (This is true on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.)

       On  NFS filesystems, reading small amounts of data will update the timestamp only the first time, sub‐
       sequent calls may not do so.  This is caused by client side attribute caching, because most if not all
       NFS clients leave st_atime (last file access time) updates to the server, and client side reads satis‐
       fied from the client's cache will not cause st_atime updates on the server as there are no server-side
       reads.   UNIX semantics can be obtained by disabling client-side attribute caching, but in most situa‐
       tions this will substantially increase server load and decrease performance.

BUGS
       According to POSIX.1-2008/SUSv4 Section XSI 2.9.7  ("Thread  Interactions  with  Regular  File  Opera‐
       tions"):

           All of the following functions shall be atomic with respect to each other in the effects specified
           in POSIX.1-2008 when they operate on regular files or symbolic links: ...

       Among the APIs subsequently listed are read() and readv(2).  And among  the  effects  that  should  be
       atomic  across  threads (and processes) are updates of the file offset.  However, on Linux before ver‐
       sion 3.14, this was not the case: if two processes that share an open file description  (see  open(2))
       perform  a read() (or readv(2)) at the same time, then the I/O operations were not atomic with respect
       updating the file offset, with the result that the reads in  the  two  processes  might  (incorrectly)
       overlap in the blocks of data that they obtained.  This problem was fixed in Linux 3.14.

 ...]                                                                                                          
    Read a line from the standard input and split it into fields.
    
    Reads a single line from the standard input, or from file descriptor FD
    if the -u option is supplied.  The line is split into fields as with word
    splitting, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME, the second
    word to the second NAME, and so on, with any leftover words assigned to
    the last NAME.  Only the characters found in $IFS are recognized as word
    delimiters.
    
    If no NAMEs are supplied, the line read is stored in the REPLY variable.
    
    Options:
      -a array  assign the words read to sequential indices of the array
                variable ARRAY, starting at zero
      -d delim  continue until the first character of DELIM is read, rather
                than newline
      -e                use Readline to obtain the line in an interactive shell
      -i text   Use TEXT as the initial text for Readline
      -n nchars return after reading NCHARS characters rather than waiting
                for a newline, but honor a delimiter if fewer than NCHARS
                characters are read before the delimiter
      -N nchars return only after reading exactly NCHARS characters, unless
                EOF is encountered or read times out, ignoring any delimiter
      -p prompt output the string PROMPT without a trailing newline before
                attempting to read
      -r                do not allow backslashes to escape any characters
      -s                do not echo input coming from a terminal
      -t timeout        time out and return failure if a complete line of input is
                not read within TIMEOUT seconds.  The value of the TMOUT
                variable is the default timeout.  TIMEOUT may be a
                fractional number.  If TIMEOUT is 0, read returns immediately,
                without trying to read any data, returning success only if
                input is available on the specified file descriptor.  The
                exit status is greater than 128 if the timeout is exceeded
      -u fd             read from file descriptor FD instead of the standard input
    
    Exit Status:
    The return code is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, read times out
    (in which case it's greater than 128), a variable assignment error occurs,
    or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument to -u.
